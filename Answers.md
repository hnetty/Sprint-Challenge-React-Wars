1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

- React is a library that makes it easier to write large programs. It eliminates the need to append items over and over to the DOM and completes the task in just one go

2. Describe component state.

- Components are repeatable bits of code that we can use to simplify and break down our code. In this particular instance, we are tracking data and the 'state' it is in

3. Describe props.

- Props are a way we pass data, usually in arrays that have been .mapped through to make it easier for us to use/manipulate

4. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

- Side effects are a powerful tool that allows us to manipulate data. They act like a more powerful functin that has a .then/.catch clause that adds an element of troubleshooting. We sync effects by calling them and passing data through, expecting certain results.
